git init is used when u are creating a file in Local repo
<br>
git init->git remote add origin(link)->git remote -v(checks/verify remote)->git branch(check branch)->git branch -M main(to raname branch optional)->git push -u origin main
-u=set upstream(upstream means in future if we work in same project all files must be pushed in origin main so in future only write git push)
